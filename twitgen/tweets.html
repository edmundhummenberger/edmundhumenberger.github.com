(RT's have been filtered to protect some nice people's reputation by mere association with this
toxic man)!

## Linux TM

Back in the 1990's Edmund attempted to trademark Linux in Germany. He issued a license agreement
to the owner of linux.de beginning a legal dispute, that ended in Edmund being forced to hand over
all rights to the Linux community.

The final "public-record" of this dispute can be found below in the following archive.

As with the trail of other legal disputes Edmund Humenberger has initiated, even the Linux trademark
dispute is very hard to trace (especially in connection with his own name) due to aggressive
confidentiality clauses that he has forced good engineers into during settlement.
